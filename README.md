# Machine learning on MRI cancer signal
This project is a part of undergoing experience on Radiomics Laboratory at USC. The aim is to apply machine learning for diagnosing risk of cancer.

## Dataset
Currently, 'mpMRI_FeatureList_CQ.xls' is the dataset that I am working on. It contains 68 records and 3 levels of cancner risk.

## Progress
- Classification algorithm comparision...
- Preprocessing including standardization, label encoding and PCA......Finished
- Explore the data set......Finished
